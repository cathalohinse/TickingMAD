General info
I carried out this project in October 2021. It is Assignment 1 for the Mobile App Development module, of the H.Dip. in Science in Computer Science in WIT. It consists of a mobile app that is used for uploading Pubs as the user ticks them (ticking a pub means drinking a pint there for the first time). There will be more features added as this application is developed. It is currently in the early stage of development.
