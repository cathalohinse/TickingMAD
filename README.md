### General info
I carried out this project in October 2021. It is Assignment 1 for the Mobile App Development module, of the H.Dip. in Science in Computer Science in WIT. It consists of a mobile app that is used for uploading Pubs as the user ticks them (ticking a pub means drinking a pint there for the first time). The user can input the name of the pub that they have 'ticked', a brief description of the pub and can submit an image of the pub. The user can also input the location of the pub, via a Google Maps API.
